# CT Liver Image Segmentation using U-Net Model

This project focuses on liver image segmentation using a U-Net model, a convolutional neural network architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks. The goal is to accurately delineate liver regions from CT scan images, aiding in medical diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features

- Utilizes the U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of liver CT scan images.
- Pre-processes and augments the dataset for model training.
- Implements loss functions and evaluation metrics tailored to medical image segmentation.
- Fine-tunes the model parameters to achieve optimal segmentation accuracy.
- Provides visualization tools for qualitative assessment of segmentation results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/CT-liver-segmentation.git
cd CT-liver-segmentation
```

### Usage

1. Prepare your liver CT scan dataset.
2. Pre-process the images and masks as needed.
3. Train the U-Net model using the provided scripts.
4. Evaluate the trained model on test data and visualize the segmentation results.
5. Fine-tune the model architecture and parameters for better performance if necessary.

Refer to the detailed documentation for more information on each step.
